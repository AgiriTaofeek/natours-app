      Here's a breakdown:
        - Tour.find(): This is a MongoDB operation that fetches documents from the Tour collection.
        - { _id: { $in: tourIds } }: This is the query object. _id is the field we're matching against, and $in is a MongoDB operator that matches any of the values specified in an array. So, { $in: tourIds } will match any document where the _id is in the tourIds array.

        In summary, this line is fetching all tour documents from the database where the tour's _id is in the tourIds array.
